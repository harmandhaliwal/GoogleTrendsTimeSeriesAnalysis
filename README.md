# GoogleTrendsTimeSeriesAnalysis
 
## Overview
In this notebook I used a dataset that contains Google trend data for the keywords diet', 'gym' and 'finance' to see how they vary over time. I scraped this dataset using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US). Next, I wrangled/cleaned the data then I preformed exploratory data analysis. Seasonality, trends, correlation, autocorrelation, and first order differencing were concepts that we looked at during the analysis.
